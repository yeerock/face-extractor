# Face Detection and Extraction

This project employs the `face-api.js` library to perform real-time face detection and extraction from images. The HTML interface allows users to choose from different images, select face detection models, adjust parameters, and visualize the detected faces.

## Features

- **Image Selection:** Choose from a variety of sample images with varying face counts.
- **Model Selection:** Toggle between the Tiny Face Detector (fast but less accurate) and the Full Version Face Detector (slower but more accurate).
- **Parameter Adjustment:** Fine-tune the maximum number of faces to detect and adjust the crop margin for optimal results.
